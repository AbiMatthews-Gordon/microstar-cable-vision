## Getting Started

This project serves as a base for the MicroStar Cable Vision Client Complaint Application. It acts as a dependency for both applications - the client and the server.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Conventions
All classes in this library are abstract and are meant to be fully implemented by the client and server respectively. As such, the class names are prefixed with an underscore to indicate their abstract state. 

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
